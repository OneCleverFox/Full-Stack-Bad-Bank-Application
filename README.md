# M.I.T. Frontend Application

## Project Title

M.I.T. Frontend Application

## Description/Motivation

The M.I.T. Frontend Application is a fully functional React-based web application that serves as the frontend for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (M.I.T.) banking application. This project was developed as part of a course to showcase skills acquired in full-stack development.

Our aim was to create a user-friendly application that enables users to perform banking transactions, manage their account information, and leverage the benefits of modern web technologies.

## Installation Guidelines

To run the M.I.T. Frontend Application on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Install Docker**: Ensure that you have Docker installed on your system.

2. **Create and Run Docker Container**:

   Use the following commands to run the application in a Docker container:

   ```bash
   # Build Docker image (execute in the project directory)
   docker build -t mit-frontend-app .

   # Run Docker container and start the application
   docker run -p 3000:3000 mit-frontend-app
   ```

   The application should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Technology Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Firebase: For user authentication.
- MongoDB: As a database with the Studio 3T interface.
- Express: A web framework for Node.js.
- Node.js: A server-side runtime environment for JavaScript.
- Docker: A containerization platform for deploying and running applications in containers.

## Features

- **Login:** Users can log in using their registered email and password. The application validates the login credentials and provides appropriate feedback for successful login or invalid credentials.

- **Registration:** New users can register by providing their name, email, password, and password confirmation. The application verifies the uniqueness of the email before creating a new user account.

- **Profile View:** After successful login, users can view their profile information, including the user's profile picture (avatar), name, email address, and current account balance.

- **Transactions:** Users can perform various types of transactions, such as deposits and withdrawals. The application keeps track of the user's transaction history and displays it on the profile screen.

- **Profile Update:** Logged-in users can update their profile information, including their name, email address, password, and profile picture (avatar).
